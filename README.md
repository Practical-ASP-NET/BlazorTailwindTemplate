# Blazor Tailwind Project Template for `dotnet new`

View on [Nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PracticalDotNet.TailwindStarterProject/).

## Install template via nuget

From anywhere on your machine you can use this command to install the template directly from Nuget.

``` bash
dotnet new --install PracticalDotNet.TailwindStarterProject::6.0-x
```

(where x is a specific version, check [versions on nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PracticalDotNet.TailwindStarterProject/)).

## Install template from source

Alternatively, if you'd prefer, you can install it yourself from the source.

Download the source then change into the `content` folder.

There's more than one template in here, so pick the one you wnant and CD into that folder.

From there you can install the template using `dotnet new --install`.

There's **no need to build anything first**. In fact, if you do build the project inside the content folder you might end up with extra folders (like bin, obj) being included in the template.

```bash
cd content
dotnet new --install .
```

In this example we instruct `dotnet` to look in the current folder (`.`) for any templates and install any it finds. 

It should find the `.template.config` folder which instructs it that this is a template for it to install.

## Spin up a new project using the template

Once you have the templates installed you should find them in the list of templates for `dotnet new`.

``` bash
dotnet new -l
```

Here's how it should appear in the listâ€¦

``` bash
Blazor WASM Tailwind Project Template         blazorwasmtw      [C#]
Blazor WASM Tailwind Project Template         blazorservertw      [C#]
```

From here you're now free to use the template to create your very own Blazor + Tailwind project!

``` bash
dotnet new blazorservertw - o ExampleApp
cd ExampleApp
dotnet watch
```

The above example creates a Tailwind CSS enabled Blazor Server project in an ExampleApp folder, then launches it using `dotnet watch`.

## JIT Mode doesn't work automatically for Blazor WASM

Tailwind (from V3 onwards) now uses JIT mode by default, whereby you can launch the Tailwind CLI in `watch` mode then, as you make changes to your markup and stylesheets, Tailwind automatically rebuilds its stylesheet.

If you create a new Blazor Server project you'll find this works automatically. This is thanks to a small library called Tailwind.Extensions.AspNetCore which you can read [more about here](https://github.com/Practical-ASP-NET/Tailwind.Extensions.AspNetCore).

It launches the Tailwind CLI in watch mode when you launch your Blazor project.

Please note this doesn't work for the Blazor WASM project (because it runs in the browser, so we have no easy way to launch Tailwind as we can on the server).

The workaround is to launch it yourself, which you can do using this command (from the root folder for your project).

``` bash
npm run buildcss:watch
```

## Upgrading/downgrading the .NET version

When you create a new project using this template you'll discover that your new project references a specific version of .NET.

Taking the above example, if you looked at `ExampleApp\ExampleApp.csproj` you should see something like this...

``` xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly" Version="6.0.0"/>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer" Version="6.0.0" PrivateAssets="all"/>
</ItemGroup>

...
```

If you wish to use a different version of .NET you will need to change the TargetFramework and Package References. There are a couple of ways to change the referenced package versions:

- Manually change the version numbers in the .csproj 
- Use the Nuget package manager in your IDE to downgrade the NuGet packages

You can also change the `TargetFramework` by manually updating the csproj or using your IDE to target a different version (for example net5.0).
